# Sankalp# 🛡️ Sankalp – The Vow to Protect Digital Truth
### Real-Time Media Integrity Agent

---

## 📖 Overview

**Sankalp** is a decentralized, Agentic AI system designed to combat misinformation by verifying the authenticity of digital media at its source.  
It assigns a **digital birth certificate** to every image, video, or statement — ensuring verifiable proof of *when, where, and by whom* it was created and guaranteeing that it remains unaltered.

Unlike detection-based solutions that identify fakes *after they go viral*, Sankalp establishes **truth before misinformation can spread**.

---

## 🧭 Problem Statement

Deepfakes, AI-generated misinformation, and edited media are eroding public trust in journalism, governance, and social media.  
Existing tools reactively detect fakes — often too late to prevent the damage.

Sankalp solves this by building **a proactive, verifiable trust layer for digital media**, combining **AI reasoning** with **blockchain-based proof**.

---

## 💡 Core Concept

> **Sankalp = AI Judgement + Blockchain Proof**

It integrates **Agentic AI** for reasoning, **blockchain** for immutability, and **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** for privacy-preserving validation.

## ⚙️ System Architecture

![Sankalp Architecture](A_flowchart_diagram_illustrates_the_architecture_o.png)

### 🔹 Components

| Agent | Role | Key Function |
|--------|------|---------------|
| **Witness Agent** | Source Registration | Extracts authenticity features (metadata, GPS, device signature) and creates a hash on the blockchain. |
| **Context Agent** | Intent & Credibility | Analyzes the source’s reputation and generates a Source Intention Score. |
| **Validator Agent** | Public Verification | Chrome extension/API for real-time trust checks. |
| **Sentinel Agent** | Tamper Detection | Scans for manipulated copies using AI and Zero-Knowledge verification. |
| **Governance Agent (DAO)** | Ethics & Oversight | Ensures transparency, appeals, and community governance. |

---

## 🧩 Workflow

1. A verified user (e.g., journalist) uploads a photo/video to the **Sankalp portal**.  
2. **Witness Agent** extracts deep authenticity features → creates a cryptographic hash → stores it on **Polygon blockchain**.  
3. **Context Agent** calculates a **Source Intention Score** based on credibility.  
4. The **Validator Agent** verifies authenticity in real-time via a **browser plugin or API**.  
5. **Sentinel Agent** continuously scans the web for forgeries and raises alerts if manipulation is detected.  
6. **Governance Agent (DAO)** oversees AI ethics and transparency of the process.
